# Welcome!

## Introduction

Thanks for trying out Nerves Livebook!

With this [Livebook](https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook) image, you can work
through tutorials, create your own livebooks and save them on device, and
import livebooks from others. We're just getting started and are super excited
with what livebooks can already do. We hope that you'll enjoy this as much as
we do and write your own livebooks and share them with the Elixir and Nerves
community.

## Getting started

You've already figured out how to install the Nerves Livebook to your device
and how to open this file, so you're well on your way!

The next steps are to try out some of the livebooks in the samples directory.
They're all read-only so you'll need to *fork* them just like you did to open
this file. At the moment, quite a few livebooks are works-in-progress. We
recommend trying the following:

* `sys_class_leds.livemd` - learn about the built-in LEDs on your device
* `wifi.livemd` - connect to the Internet over WiFi
* `firmware_update.livemd` - download the latest Nerves Livebook firmware

## Saving and copying files

This file and the samples are read-only since they're built into Nerves
Livebook. Your files can be saved anywhere in `/data` which is writable
like a drive on your computer. Firmware updates using the `firmware_update.livemd`
won't erase your files. Be careful, though, if you remove the MicroSD card
and re-initialize it in your computer. That will erase them.

If you want to copy a file off the Nerves Livebook image, open up a shell
on your computer and run `sftp livebook@nerves.local`. The password is `nerves`.
Once you're logged in, navigate to `/data/livebooks` or where ever you stored
your files and run `get` to copy them off.

## Limitations

If you've used Livebooks before, the Nerves Livebook image has a few
differences:

1. All code gets evaluated in one Erlang VM. This is convenient for Nerves
   devices, but you may be surprised when a module defined in one livebook is
   then accessible in another.
2. Installing hex dependencies is not supported. The Nerves Livebook contains
   may useful libraries for Nerves. For the time being, if useful one is
   missing please file an [issue](https://github.com/fhunleth/nerves_livebook/issues)
   so it can be considered for inclusion.
