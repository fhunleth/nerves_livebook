# Pulse Width Modulation Using Pigpiox

## Introduction

In this exercise, we will leverage the [pigpiox][pigpiox_github] library to brighten and dim an LED through software [PWM][pwm_wiki] (pulse width modulation).

## Try it out

Lets set a variable so that we dont have to choose the GPIO pin every time.

First, refer to the GPIO ports for your Nerves device. In this example, we will be using pin 20 on the Raspberry Pi platform.

```elixir
led_pin = 20
```

Alright! Now that we've selected a pin, make sure that we connect
the to our `led_pin` and `ground` through a 220Ω resistor. The long leg
can be connected to our `led_pin` and the short pin can connect from 
the shorter leg to a 220Ω resistor, then to our ground.

Now we will create a connection to that GPIO pin and set it as an :output.

```elixir
Pigpiox.GPIO.set_mode(led_pin, :output)
```

After our `led_pin` has been configured as an `:output`, lets turn it on at 10% brightness.

```elixir
#Pigpiox.Pwm.gpio_pwm(led_pin, 255) # 100%
#Pigpiox.Pwm.gpio_pwm(led_pin, 127) # 50%
Pigpiox.Pwm.gpio_pwm(led_pin, 25)  # 10%
#Pigpiox.Pwm.gpio_pwm(led_pin, 2)   # 1%
```

As you can see above, you can run the PWM cycles between `0` and `255`, or the max size of a byte.

Lets go ahead and write a basic defmodule that can dim or brighten the LED using recursion.

```elixir
defmodule PWM do
  # Repeat brightening forever
  def forever(output_gpio, brightness \\ 0, delay \\ 10, direction \\ true) do
    Pigpiox.Pwm.gpio_pwm(output_gpio, brightness)
    Process.sleep(delay)
    # Increase the brightness by 1 ever iteration until max, then return to zero.
    brightness = if direction, do: brightness + 1, else: brightness - 1
    # flip the direction if over max u8 or at min u8
    direction = if brightness > 254 or brightness < 1, do: !direction, else: direction
    # Recursively call the function
    forever(output_gpio, brightness, delay, direction)
  end
end

PWM.forever(led_pin)
```

For a fun exercise, see if you can change the `PWM.forever` function to only brighten to 50% in the forever loop.
