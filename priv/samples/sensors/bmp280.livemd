# Hello BMP280

## Introduction

This sample demonstrates how to read temperature data from the BMP280 temperature sensor board.
We will use [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) protocol to connect a sensor board to our Nerves target device (e.g., Raspbery Pi).

## Nerves target

The explanation below assumes a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) as a target device but other [Nerves targets](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html) should work as well.

## Sensor board

The [Bosch BMP280 sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/pressure-sensors/) itself is so tiny that it might be difficult to handle but some electronics components manufactureres mount it on a [breakout board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) for our convenience, which is what we look for. Do [Google search by "BMP280 breakout board"](https://www.google.com/search?q=bmp280+breakout+board) and you will find something like [Adafruit BMP280 Sensor board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651).

You can alternatively use [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) or [BME680](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors-bme680/) since the [elixir-sensors/bmp280](https://github.com/elixir-sensors/bmp280) library supports them.

## Wiring

Roughly speaking, there are typically two ways to hook up a sensor to our Nerves target.

### A: Pin header

If you already have a [soldering iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering_iron) and enjoy using it, this is the go-to option. Even if you have not already, soldering can be fun. This option only requires a [pin header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_header) and 4 [jumper wires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_wire)

[I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) protocol uses 4 pins. It is confusing but different products may name the  pins differently.

| Target (I2C controller) | Sensor (I2C peripheral) | Description                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 3.3V                    | Vin                     | power                             |
| GND                     | GND                     | common ground for power and logic |
| I2C SDA (GPIO 2)        | SDA                     | I2C data                          |
| I2C SCL (GPIO 3)        | SCL                     | I2C clock                         |

### B: Qwiic Connect System etc

Taking advantage of [Qwiic Connect System](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) or similar system, we can remove the need for the soldering. One tradeoff is that we need to get an extra board like [Qwiic HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4688) and special wires.

## Elixir libraries

All the heavy lifting is done by the following Elixir libraries:

- [elixir-sensors/bmp280](https://github.com/elixir-sensors/bmp280)
- [elixir-circuits/circuits_i2c](https://github.com/elixir-circuits/circuits_i2c)

## Detecting connected I2C devices

We want to make sure that our sensor board is wired properly. Most sensors are at address `0x77`, but some are at `0x76`.

```elixir
Circuits.I2C.detect_devices()
```

## Initializing BMP280 server

```elixir
{:ok, bmp} = BMP280.start_link(bus_name: "i2c-1", bus_address: 0x77)
```

## Checking sensor type

```elixir
BMP280.sensor_type(bmp)
```

## Reading data from the sensor

```elixir
{:ok, measurement} = BMP280.measure(bmp)
```

## Correcting altitude

The altitude measurement is computed from the measured barometric pressure. To be accurate, it requires either the current sea level pressure or the current altitude.

For example, if your location's altitude is 100 meters, pass `100` to the `BMP280.force_altitude/1` function.

```elixir
altitude_of_your_location = 100
BMP280.force_altitude(bmp, altitude_of_your_location)
```

Subsequent altitude reports should be more accurate until the weather changes.

```elixir
{:ok, measurement} = BMP280.measure(bmp)
```
